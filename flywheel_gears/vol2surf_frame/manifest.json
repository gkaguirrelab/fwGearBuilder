The target image can be located in nested folders in that archive, the gear will find it. If you have an archive and you want to find and analyze multiple images of the same type in that archive, you can enter a small common part of the image names and all of the images that include that part will be found (e.g. you can enter something like desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz to find all the preprocessed images in an fmriprep archive)",
